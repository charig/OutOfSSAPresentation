## Presentation Instructions
The main content is written in markdown. Install [Reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) for presentation mode.

(also recommended is installing reveal.js-menu: `npm install --save reveal.js-menu`)

Then, inside the reveal folder, add a link to the folder in which this repo was cloned:
    
    ln -s pathToClonedDir presentations
    npm start

Finally go to your favorite browser and browse the following url: *http://localhost:8000/presentations/OutOfSSA.html*
